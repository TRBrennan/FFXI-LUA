1) Hello,

After investigating this issue by reviewing the logs and the code, it seems this issue is coming from a 3rd party application (if possible add the name). To help resolve this issue I would reach out to the 3rd party supplier,
with the following evidence and logs. If you need any further assistance from Caplin please do not hesitate to reach out and we will do our best to assist you with solving this issue.

Kind Regards,
Tom Brennan

2) The log is an SSL log using TLSv1.2 There is a issue with the chiper being used from the client to the server which is stopping the client connecting to the server via TLS correctly.
I would review the ciphers being used on the server and the ones selected by the Truststore containing the certifcates and make sure these are correct and matching. Confirm chiper setting in the code is correct.

3)  
 grep -c "WARNING: " datasource.log 
 grep "WARNING: " datasource.log
 grep 'STATUS: UP, STATUS:DONW' datasource.log
 awk -v 'start='9:26:18.000' -v end='9:26:56.000' '
   /^[[:digit:]]{4}-[[:digit:]]{2}-[[:digit:]]{2} / {
     inrange = $0 >= start && $0 <= end
   }
   inrange' < datasource.log
 
 
 4)
 I would request the log files and enable debug mode, time stamp of the log in attempt. Network connectivity tests with netcap or something similar to confirm they are able to reach the log in server.
 
 5) I would use network tools in the browser to trace what is being sent to and from the browser over the network. Use the developer tools to see how the screen is reacting to inputs
 Maybe enable a TCP Capture to trace packets being sent.
 
 6) 
 It's publishing a message to an active queue called /TEST/SUBSCRIBE, which if has the subject is container it adds the element 'RECORD', however it contains 'RECORD' the code will populate the message with various rates and then publish it.
 There is also a service to run a new fixed rate to the subcribed peers and will throw an expection if this fails.
